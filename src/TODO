 - JavaFXEuropeanChessDisplay:
     + utilize setBackground
     + setGraphic in displayFilledSquare (has to be sth != null)
     + For the pieces, you would add a second BackgroundFill to the background
        but this time use the color for the piece's side,
        and set the CorderRadii and Insets so that the piece is rounded
        and allows the background color behind it to be visible.
